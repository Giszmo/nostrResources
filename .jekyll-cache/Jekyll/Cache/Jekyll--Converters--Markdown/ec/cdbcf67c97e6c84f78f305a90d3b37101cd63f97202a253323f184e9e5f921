  <p>Gossip follows people at they relays they profess to post to. That means it has to discover which relays those are (see https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/65.md) and make smart relay selection choices based on things like which relays cover the most people you follow.</p>

  <p>Gossip handles private keys as securely as reasonable (short of hardware tokens), keeping them encrypted under a passphrase on disk, requiring that passphrase on startup, and zeroing memory.</p>

  <p>Gossip avoids web technologies (other than HTTP GET and WebSockets). Web technologies like HTML parsing and rendering, CSS, JavaScript and the very many web standards, are complex and represent a security hazard due to such a large attack surface. This isnâ€™t just a pedantic or theoretical concern; people have already had their private key stolen from other nostr clients. We use simple OpenGL-style rendering instead. Itâ€™s not as pretty but it gets the job done.</p>
