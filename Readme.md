Several projects track nostr resources. With this project under a permissive
license we hope to get all Nostriches on board to build the most accurate and
up to date repository of NOSTR projects to then embed that raw, machine-readable
data in those projects.

nostr.info switched to using this resource as data source. You can study or straight copy from https://github.com/Giszmo/nostr.info to integrate in your own project. It's licensed MIT.
