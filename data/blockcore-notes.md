> Notes app for decentralized infrastructures (Nostr and Web5)
> 
> Blockcore Notes is an app for your public and personal notes. It is built to support the Nostr and Web5 (coming in the future).
>
> The Nostr support for Blockcore Notes relies on using your Nostr identity (public key) and uses a set of relays to publish and store your notes. You can run your own personal relay to always keep a backup of your notes.
