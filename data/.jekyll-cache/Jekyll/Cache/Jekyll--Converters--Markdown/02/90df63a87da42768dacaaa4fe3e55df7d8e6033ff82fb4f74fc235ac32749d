  <p>Notes app for decentralized infrastructures (Nostr and Web5)</p>

  <p>Blockcore Notes is an app for your public and personal notes. It is built to support the Nostr and Web5 (coming in the future).</p>

  <p>The Nostr support for Blockcore Notes relies on using your Nostr identity (public key) and uses a set of relays to publish and store your notes. You can run your own personal relay to always keep a backup of your notes.</p>
