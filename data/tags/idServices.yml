  You are who you say you really are. That's the core assumption that a blue twitter 
  checkmark conveys to its holders. On centralized platforms like Twitter or Facebook, 
  this is done with varying levels of KYC. Some require identification documents and 
  some offer extra services such as [Facebook's Verified Badge](https://www.facebook.com/help/1288173394636262). 
  In Nostr, a decentralized-network, the mechanics are different since there is no 
  centralized authority to tell people that you are who you really are. This is expounded
  further in NIP-05, where "Nostr keys are mapped to DNS-based internet identifiers". 
  Some of these services are for pay, with nothing more than a few satoshis to include 
  a user's name included inside the json file in a folder located
  inside the root directory of a domain.
