> Member is a bridge between multiple decentralized social networks. It operates on the BitClout, Bitcoin Cash, Hive and Membercoin blockchains and the relay based Nostr network. Members have a single login that can read, follow, like, tip, post and reply across multiple networks. Notably it also has reputational ratings and geolocated posts. It is a 'fat' javascript client app that runs against a relatively dumb server.
