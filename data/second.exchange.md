> Right now, this tool can be used to promote content freely anywhere by anyone, we intend to make this tool for anyone to learn, discuss ideas with value associated to it. In our experiment, 1)communities tend to form around value, 2) the existing social media is free to use hence no quality output gets generated, 3) then there are issues of valuation.
